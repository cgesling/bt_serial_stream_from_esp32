# bt_serial_stream_from_esp32

First attempt to write a flutter application that connects to an ESP32 and is able to control outputs on command from Mobile application. 

This project is able to connect to 5 different ESP32s and keep communication with all concurrently to automate electronics on a boat. 

== Current issues==
- Livewell Timers need to be re-written in better form
- Depending on Device used - there may be UI overflow issues on the Livewell controls screen 

Code for the ESP32 needs to be added to this project.
